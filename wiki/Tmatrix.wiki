==Barber and Hill scattering by axisymmetric particles (T-matrix method)==
These codes were published in "Light Scattering by Particles: Computational Methods", P.W. Barber and S.C. Hill, 1990 by World Scientific Publishing. There are nine computer programs
which may be used to calculate the light scattered by nonspherical
particles.  An auxiliary program determines array dimensions for
the nine basic programs.

The source code is available here [http://scatterlib.googlecode.com/files/barber.zip barber.zip].
